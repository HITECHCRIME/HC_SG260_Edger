## Lyrics

```
we've been moving through nights on the downlow
putting heavy tags on the forlorn mags on the waist
there's never time to waste, we should go for the best row
marching through the days

spectacle about start, it's hands-on, 
fast to the curb, better not stand in our way
x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x grow cold

edge of the night


```
